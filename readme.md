- it's flashcards with emoji

## how to use it
it's running here: https://bacalj.github.io/funtimes/

or build it locally:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run sass
```
serve the index file however you like, but 
```
$ php -S localhost:1313
```
is perfectly respectable

## made with: 
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
